# Pathways data

A store with minimal data collection to perform pathways analysis with [pathways-analysis](https://github.com/kn-bibs/pathways-analysis) software.


## For contributors

Method-specific files should be placed in directories named after the method. Files common to multiple methods should go into the `common` directory and be placed in appropriate sub-directories.

### Always compress your files

GitHub states clearly that users are bound by kind of a fair usage policy of the provided bandwidth, 
and that excessive usage may result in account suspension or bandwidth throttling (see: [Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#7-excessive-bandwidth-use)).

Just to be fair, we should always compress all files we include in the repository.
Also, when using this repository, please try to cache the downloaded files whenever possible.

### Always check and add a licence

Before adding a file please double-check that its licence allows to re-distribute all content in this file.

Each directory is required to contain a `LICENCE` file unless it has no non-directory children and all children directories fulfill this condition.

In the `LICENCE` file please provide both: the full text to the licence and copyright information as used by the content owners;
Additionally a link to a page with licence or terms of usage for given dataset is recommended.
